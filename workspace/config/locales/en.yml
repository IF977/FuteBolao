    guesses: >
      Each guess must be saved until the start time of the match.
      After the start of each match it will not be possible to change your guess, and all
      the guesses for that match will become public. When the match ends the ranking will be
      updated according to the users scores.
    score: "It's possible to score 1 or 3 points"
    score_3: >
      In order to score 3 points the user needs to guess the exact result of the match. For example,
      if the match's result is BRA 3 x 0 USA the user guess must also be BRA 3 x 0 USA in order to 
      score 3 points (the same is true for draws).
    score_1: >
      In order to score 1 point the user needs to guess only the winner or if it's a draw, but never the
      exact result.
      For example, if the match's result is BRA 3 x 0 USA and the user guess is BRA 2 x 1 USA the user will score 1
      point. The same is true for draws. For example, if match's result is BRA 1 x 1 USA and the user guess is BRA 2 x 2 USA
      the user will score 1 point.
